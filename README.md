## MoneyManager
Manage your money with minimal fuss. Run everything locally.


A Money Manager that runs on local host and persists data on a local database (Mongo)

A Web interface allows users to edit expenditure in a simple tabular form.

How is this better than most other money managers out there?
- Allows splitting expenses for those expenses that are not just for the user.
- Allows creation of custom expense categories and automatic assignment of expenses to those categories.
- Crawls text messages and emails to automatically fill in expenses from notifications.

Will add more feature once the basic CRUD functionality is setup.
